# Biodiversity Data Space

This repository hosts architecture, documentation, and implementation resources for the Biodiversity Meets Data (BMD) Data Space: a cloud-native, FAIR-aligned infrastructure designed to support biodiversity monitoring, conservation planning, and policy reporting.

The BMD Data Space will integrate high-throughput and legacy biodiversity and environmental data into harmonised, analysis-ready data cubes. It will support access through Virtual Research Environments (VREs), a Single Access Point (SAP), APIs, and standardised metadata catalogues. Built on open lakehouse principles and aligned with the Green Deal Data Space and EOSC frameworks, the infrastructure will enable scalable, interoperable, and reusable biodiversity data services.
